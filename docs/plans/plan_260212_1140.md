## 1. Problem Statement

The original plan ([plan_260212_0933.md](plan_260212_0933.md)) for the ModelHub library and code refactoring has been fully implemented (Phases 0-3). However, the documentation (Phase 4) has not been updated to reflect the new project structure, ModelHub integration, and updated test counts.

**Current Issues:**

- README.md references `VoiceModels.cs` as a single file (now split into 11 files)
- README.md project structure doesn't include the ModelHub library
- Test count shows 37 instead of 67 (37 web + 30 ModelHub)
- No documentation for automatic model download feature
- No documentation for ModelHub configuration options
- `temp-check/` diagnostic utility is tracked in git but shouldn't be
- `model-cache/` directory is not in `.gitignore`

## 2. Changes Required

### 2.1 Documentation

- **Update README.md** with:
  - Updated project structure showing ModelHub library and split Models/
  - Updated test count (67 total)
  - New section on automatic model download
  - ModelHub configuration options
  - Updated coding standards (one-class-per-file rule)

### 2.2 Cleanup

- **Remove `temp-check/`** directory (diagnostic script, not production code)
- **Update `.gitignore`** to include `model-cache/` directory

## 3. Success Criteria

- [ ] README.md accurately reflects current project structure
- [ ] ModelHub auto-download feature is documented
- [ ] ModelHub configuration options are documented
- [ ] Test count updated to 67
- [ ] `temp-check/` removed from repo
- [ ] `model-cache/` added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] All existing tests still pass (67 tests)
